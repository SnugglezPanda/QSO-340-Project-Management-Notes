* Establishing and maintaining active communication with stakeholders;
* Managing resources; and
* Balancing the competing project constraints, which include but are not limited to:

  <li> Risk</li>
  </ul>

<strong>1.2 Relationships Among Portfolios, Programs, and Projects</strong>

A portfolio is defined as projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed in a coordinated manner to achieve strategic objectives. Portfolio management is the centeralized management of one or more portfolios to achieve strategic objectives. 

It focuses on ensuring a portfolio performance is consistent with the organization's objectives and evaluating portfolio components to optimize resource allocation.

A program is defined as related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available from manageing them individiually. Programs include program related work outside the scope of the discrete projects in the program.

Program management supports organizational strategies by authorizing, changing, or terminating projects and managing their interdependencies.

Managing project interdependencies may include:

* Resolving resource constraints and/or conflicts that affect components within the program;
* Aligning with the organization's strategies that impact and affect program goals and objectives;
* Managing issues and employing change management within a shared governance structure;
* Addressing project and program risks that can impact one or more components; and
* Managing program beneftis realization by effectively by effectively analyzin, sequencing and monitoring cp,[pmemt interdependencies

A project may be managed in three spearate scenarios:
1. As a Stand-alone project (outside a portfolio or program);
2. Within a program
3. Withing a portfolio

Organizational project management (OPM) is a strategy execution framework utilizing portfolio, program, and project manaegment. It provides framework that enables organizations to consistently and predictably deliver on organizational strategy, producing better performance, better results, and a sustanable competitive advantage.

-----------------------------------

To effectively manage projects, practitioners need a unique combination of skills, expertise, and knowledge, to help teams bring their projects to completion in the most productive and efficient way possible. A talented project manager* who can employ the concrete tools*, techniques*, and methodologies*—as well as the less-concrete "interpersonal skills*"—can be the difference between a successful project and an unmitigated disaster.

### Project Stakehohlders

Project management involves coordinating and considering the needs of project stakeholders. A stakeholder may be an individual person, an organization, or a larger entity that has an interest in the project or is actively involved in the project in some way. 

project stakeholders are those who can affect the project, who can be affected by the project, or who simply believe they can be affected by the project.
