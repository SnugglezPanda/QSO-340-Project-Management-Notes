It focuses on ensuring a portfolio performance is consistent with the organization's objectives and evaluating portfolio components to optimize resource allocation.

A program is defined as related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available from manageing them individiually. Programs include program related work outside the scope of the discrete projects in the program.

Managing project interdependencies may include:

* Resolving resource constraints and/or conflicts that affect components within the program;
* Aligning with the organization's strategies that impact and affect program goals and objectives;

2. Within a program
3. Withing a portfolio

To effectively manage projects, practitioners need a unique combination of skills, expertise, and knowledge, to help teams bring their projects to completion in the most productive and efficient way possible. A talented project manager* who can employ the concrete tools*, techniques*, and methodologies*—as well as the less-concrete "interpersonal skills*"—can be the difference between a successful project and an unmitigated disaster.
